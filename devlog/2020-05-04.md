* ✅Add field (Maybe Square) to Position, when moving pawn update it
    * 🙂Obvious way
    * 😡Position pattern matching will look ugly
    * 🙂En-passant is really a part of position, so there's no choice actually
* ❌Has two fields whiteEnPassant & blackenPassant
    * 😡Ugly, with no benefit
* ❌Make Maybe Square a part of Board

    * 🙂En passant is just a capture


**How to make en passant move?**
* ❌If in moveChessman
    * 😡Ugly
* ❌If in makeUnchecked

**How to fix problem of non-exhaustive en passant patterns?**
* ❌Add default pattern and throw error
    * 🙂Simple
