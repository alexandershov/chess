**How to implement en passant?**
* ✅Add field (Maybe Square) to Position, when moving pawn update it
    * 🙂Obvious way
    * 😡Position pattern matching will look ugly
    * 🙂En-passant is really a part of position, so there's no choice actually
* ❌Has two fields whiteEnPassant & blackenPassant
    * 😡Ugly, with no benefit
* ❌Make Maybe Square a part of Board
    * 😡enPassant is not on board, it's a part of Position
