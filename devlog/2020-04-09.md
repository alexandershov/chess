**How to handle different cases for own and opponent pieces in deltas?**
```haskell
let goodDeltas = takeWhile isOnBoard deltas
let reallyGoodDeltas = takeWhile+1 isEmpty goodDeltas
excludeOwnPieces
```
* ðŸ™‚Clear
* ðŸ˜¡Need to implement takeWhile+1
* ðŸ™‚takeWhile+1 is really easy defined in terms of span
* ðŸ™‚So good I can't even find an alternative
