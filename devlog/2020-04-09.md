**How to handle different cases for own and opponent pieces in deltas?**
```haskell
let goodDeltas = takeWhile isOnBoard deltas
let reallyGoodDeltas = takeWhile+1 isEmpty goodDeltas
excludeOwnPieces
```
* 🙂Clear
* 😡Need to implement takeWhile+1
* 🙂takeWhile+1 is really easy defined in terms of span
* 🙂So good I can't even find an alternative

**How to write piecesOnSquares?**
* ✅Convert to list and use filter/list/comprehension
    * 🙂Simple
    * 😡Need conversion to list
    * 🙂I still need a list in the end
* ❌Use traversable/foldable/etc on array
    * 😡Maybe hard
    * 🙂Native to array, no full conversion to list needed
    * 😡There's no indices in traversable/foldable/etc
