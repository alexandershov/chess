**How to implement minimax?**
* ❌rename eval -> evalLeaf|staticEval and do minimax in eval
      use evalLeaf if we at the max depth or at the leaf node
      Tree is virtual
    🙂Looks classic
* ❌same as previous, but Tree is real: 
  data DecisionTree = DecisionTree Score [DecisionTree]
  * 😡Not as elegant, as implicit tree via recursion
* ✅same as first, but use negamax
    * 🙂Pretty cool, and it'll look easier to read
