**How to implement forcing variations?**
* ✅When you're at the leaf node, then do only forcing moves with another depth
    * 🙂Simple
    * 😡What if we're at the limit of forcing moves depth and there's another capture?
* ❌When you're at the leaf node, do only forcing moves till there's no forcing moves
    * 😡Forcing moves can continue to no end
* ❌Have different depth for checks and captures and consider checks and captures separately
    * 🙂Interesting idea
    * 😡Seems like an overkill right now


**What is a forcing move?**
* ✅Captures & checks
    * 🙂These are the most important
* ❌Captures, checks and threats
    * 🙂These cover everything
    * 😡It's unclear how to formalize threat
* ❌Only checks
    * 😡What if we can just take a piece?
* ❌Only captures
    * 😡What if there's a mate?
