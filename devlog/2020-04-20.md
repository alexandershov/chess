**How to exclude illegal moves?**
* Add legalMoves function, add filtering of allMoves so my king is not threatened after
    * 🙂Can reuse allMoves
* Return only legal moves in allMoves
    * 😡We still need allMoves to gather all threats
* Add isAtCheck to every Position
    * 😡Who is at check? Side to move?
    * 😡We should not generate illegal positions


**How to add randomness?**
* ❌findBestMove is IO Move and does the real random choice
    * 🙂Very simple
    * 😡findBestMove is not a pure function after that
    * 😡Is it possible?
* ❌Store random generator IORef in Currychnoi and pass it to findBestMove
    * 🙂findBestMove remains a pure function
    * 😡Using IORef
* ✅move findBestMove to UCI, rename it to something and make it IO Move
    * 🙂Simple
    * 🙂Not a part of Position anymore and doesn't need to be pure
