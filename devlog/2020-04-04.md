**FilePath or Logger?**
* ❌FilePath
    * 🙂Simple
    * 😡Hard to test
* ✅Logger
    * 🙂Can be tested
    * 😡Extra abstration


**How does the `play` function look like?**

❌
```haskell
play :: Player -> Logger -> IO ()
play player log =
    forever do
        input <- getLine
        logInput log input
        response = getResponse player (parse input)
        logResponse log response
        printResponse

getResponse :: Player -> Command -> IO Response
getResponse player command = do
    case command of
        Uci -> return uciOkResponse
        IsReady -> return readyOkResponse
        UciNewGame -> return emptyResponse
        Position -> return emptyResponse
        Go -> move player
```
* 🙂Clear code
* 😡Hard to test input/output of commands/responses

❌
```haskell
play :: Player -> Logger -> IO ()
play player log =
    input <- getContents
    responses <- mapM getResponse (map parse (lines input))
    mapM printResponses responses
```
* 😡Looks impossible

✅ 
```haskell
play :: SomeIO :: Player -> IO ()

-- rest is the same as the first variant
```
* 🙂Clear code
* 🙂Can be tested
