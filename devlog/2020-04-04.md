**FilePath or Logger?**
* ❌FilePath
    * 🙂Simple
    * 😡Hard to test
* ✅Logger
    * 🙂Can be tested
    * 😡Extra abstration


**How does the `play` function look like?**

❌
```haskell
play :: Player -> Logger -> IO ()
play player log =
    forever do
        input <- getLine
        logInput log input
        response = getResponse player (parse input)
        logResponse log response
        printResponse

getResponse :: Player -> Command -> IO Response
getResponse player command = do
    case command of
        Uci -> return uciOkResponse
        IsReady -> return readyOkResponse
        UciNewGame -> return emptyResponse
        Position -> return emptyResponse
        Go -> move player
```
* 🙂Clear code
* 😡Hard to test input/output of commands/responses

❌
```haskell
play :: Player -> Logger -> IO ()
play player log =
    input <- getContents
    responses <- mapM getResponse (map parse (lines input))
    mapM printResponses responses
```
* 😡Looks impossible

✅ 
```haskell
play :: SomeIO :: Player -> IO ()

-- rest is the same as the first variant
```
* 🙂Clear code
* 🙂Can be tested


**How to name SomeIO?**

* ❌UciIO
    * 😡Stuttering, module is already named Uci
* ❌IO
    * 😡Clashes with system IO
* ❌InputOutput
    * 😡What's the difference from the system IO?
* ❌InOut
    * 😡What's the difference from the the system IO?
* ❌ReaderWriter
    * 😡Hate it
* ❌Reader & Writer (two arguments)
    * 😡Function will have 4 arguments, that's too much
* ❌Reader & Writer with logging incorporated
    * 😡Not specific
* ❌Input & Output (two arguments) with logging incorporated
    * 😡Not specific
* ✅CommandReader & ResponseWriter with logging incorporated
    * 🙂specific
