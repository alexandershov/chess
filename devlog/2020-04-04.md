**FilePath or Logger?**
* ❌FilePath
    * 🙂Simple
    * 😡Hard to test
* ✅Logger
    * 🙂Can be tested
    * 😡Extra abstration


**How does the `play` function look like?**

❌
```haskell
play :: Player -> Logger -> IO ()
play player log =
    forever do
        input <- getLine
        logInput log input
        response = getResponse player (parse input)
        logResponse log response
        printResponse

getResponse :: Player -> Command -> IO Response
getResponse player command = do
    case command of
        Uci -> return uciOkResponse
        IsReady -> return readyOkResponse
        UciNewGame -> return emptyResponse
        Position -> return emptyResponse
        Go -> move player
```
* 🙂Clear code
* 😡Hard to test input/output of commands/responses

❌
```haskell
play :: Player -> Logger -> IO ()
play player log =
    input <- getContents
    responses <- mapM getResponse (map parse (lines input))
    mapM printResponses responses
```
* 😡Looks impossible

✅ 
```haskell
play :: SomeIO :: Player -> IO ()

-- rest is the same as the first variant
```
* 🙂Clear code
* 🙂Can be tested


**How to name SomeIO?**

* ❌UciIO
    * 😡Stuttering, module is already named Uci
* ❌IO
    * 😡Clashes with system IO
* ❌InputOutput
    * 😡What's the difference from the system IO?
* ❌InOut
    * 😡What's the difference from the the system IO?
* ❌ReaderWriter
    * 😡Hate it
* ❌Reader & Writer (two arguments)
    * 😡Function will have 4 arguments, that's too much
* ❌Reader & Writer with logging incorporated
    * 😡Not specific
* ❌Input & Output (two arguments) with logging incorporated
    * 😡Not specific
* ✅CommandReader & ResponseWriter with logging incorporated
    * 🙂specific


**What's the definition of CommandReader type class?**
* ✅read :: a -> IO Command
* ❌readCommand :: a -> IO Command
    * 😡Stuttering


**What's Uci.Response?**
* ❌alias for [String]
    * 😡No type checks
* ✅data Response = Response [String]
    * 🙂Simplest way
    * 🙂Command is Data, so it should also be Data
* newtype
    * 😡Same as data, but strict, I don't need that
* ❌same as all previous, but String instead of [String]
    * 😡Can't represent both no Response and empty string Response  with that

**What's the definition of Player type class?**
* ❌move :: a -> IO Response
    * 😡It doesn't actually moves
* ❌makeMove
    * 😡It doesn't actually makes a move
* ❌bestMove
    * 🙂Specific and precise
    * 😡Not a verb
* ❌findBestMove :: a -> IO Response
    * 🙂*Really* specific and precise
    * 🙂It's a verb!
    * 😡IO Response is not a move
* ✅findBestMove :: a -> IO String
    * 🙂best of all possible worlds, later String will be changed to some Move type
