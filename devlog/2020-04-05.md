**Turk always reopens file. How to fix it?**

* ❌Pass hGetLine handle as an argument to play
    * 😡I like the turk abstraction, here it dissappears
* ✅Turk without do notation, takes a handle
    * 🙂The simplest way and pretty good too
* ❌Somehow return delayed action from turk
    * 😡Right now I'm not proficient in Haskell enough to make it work
