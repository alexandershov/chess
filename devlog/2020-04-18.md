**How to implement pawn moves?**
* ✅Separate PawnMovement data constructor with different fields
    * 🙂Reflects reality: pawn movement is indeed a separate beast.
* ❌Add captureDeltas & moveDelta to Movement
    * 🙂General
    * 😡That'll lead to a fat Movement class
    * 😡Later with promotions and en passants it'll lead to fatter interface
* ❌Separate case for a Pawn based on piece
    * 😡Ugly


**Should we pass square to getMovement?**
* ✅Yes
    * 🙂That's the only way we can return full movement
* ❌No
    * 😡We'll need to do some ugly handling of the pawn on the initial square then


**How to implement & test black pawn moves?**
* ❌Little bit of copy-paste
    * 😡Ugh
* ❌Extract some common code
    * 🙂By the textbook
    * 😡Tests will be less readable
* ✅Copy-paste tests and extract some common code in real code
    * 🙂Readable tests
    * 🙂No copy-paste where it matters
