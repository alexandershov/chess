**How to add pawn promotion?**
* ✅Add Maybe Piece to the Move
    * 🙂Obvious way
* ❌Move is ((from, Piece), (to, Piece))
    * 😡This is nice and symmetrical but Piece in from is always the same, so it kinda artificial

**How to parse promotion & color?**
* ❌Change Piece Color to Piece PieceKind Color
    * 😡Huge change with little other benefit
* ✅Parse correct Color from UCI
    * 🙂Least amount of code
    * 😡Adding some logic to UCI parsing
* ❌When parsing always parse White, when promoting convert to correct color 
    * 😡Ugly hack
