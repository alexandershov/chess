**What's the board represenation?**

* ✅Immutable 8x8 array
    * 🙂Reflects reality, obvious choice
* ❌list of lists
    * 🙂Haskell is good at lists
    * 😡O(n) complexity of getting item. Well it's actually O(16), still not great :)
* ❌larger than 8x8 array
    * 😡I don't quite understand how it makes the code better. And I don't want to read it right now because first stage should be done by using only my head.
* ❌bitboards
    * 😡Harder to implement
    * 😡Speed is not needed right now
* Mutable array
    * 😡Looks like premature optimization


**What's the Position representation?**

* ✅Record Position {board, whiteCastlingRight, blackCastling, moveOrder, enPassant, 50moves, history}
    * 🙂Clear and simple
* ❌Same as previous, but ADT
    * 😡Extracting fields will be painful


**What's the Piece represenation?**
* ✅data Piece = Pawn Color | Knight Color | ...
    * 🙂Reflects reality: all pieces are colored in real life
    * 😡Reads backwards Pawn White, I would prefer White Pawn (could be solved with some operator White <> Pawn)
* ❌data Piece = Pawn | Knight | ...
    * 😡It doesn't look like there'll be a place in code where color is irrelevant
* ❌pawn = 0, knight = 1
    * 😡ugly and no advantages
* ❌data Piece = Record {kind, color}
    * 😡Still not readable enough
* data PieceKind = Pawn | Knight
* ❌data Piece = White PieceKind | Black PieceKind
    * 🙂Looks great White Knight
    * 😡Color abstraction is lost
* ❌Make Color a function somehow
    * 😡Doesn't look possible


**What's the color representation?**
* ✅data Color = Black | White
    * 🙂Simple and clear
* ❌black = 0, white = 1
    * 😡ugly
