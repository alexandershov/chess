**What's the board represenation?**

* ✅8x8 array
    * 🙂Reflects reality, obvious choice
* ❌list of lists
    * 🙂Haskell is good at lists
    * 😡O(n) complexity of getting item. Well it's actually O(16), still not great :)
* ❌larger than 8x8 array
    * 😡I don't quite understand how it makes the code better. And I don't want to read it right now because first stage should be done by using only my head.
* ❌bitboards
    * 😡Harder to implement
    * 😡Speed is not needed right now
