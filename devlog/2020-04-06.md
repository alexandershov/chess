**What's the board represenation?**

* ✅Immutable 8x8 array
    * 🙂Reflects reality, obvious choice
* ❌list of lists
    * 🙂Haskell is good at lists
    * 😡O(n) complexity of getting item. Well it's actually O(16), still not great :)
* ❌larger than 8x8 array
    * 😡I don't quite understand how it makes the code better. And I don't want to read it right now because first stage should be done by using only my head.
* ❌bitboards
    * 😡Harder to implement
    * 😡Speed is not needed right now
* Mutable array
    * 😡Looks like premature optimization


**What's the Position representation?**

* ✅Record Position {board, whiteCastlingRight, blackCastling, moveOrder, enPassant, 50moves, history}
    * 🙂Clear and simple
* ❌Same as previous, but ADT
    * 😡Extracting fields will be painful
