**How to implement castling?**
* Add castling flags to the Position, when rook/king taken/moved it changes castling flags
  check if king passed squares under attack
* 

**How to represent castling move?**
* ✅Move e1 g1
    * 🙂Easy to parse from UCI
    * 🙂Not many changes
    * 😡Not specific
    * 😡Not clear that it's a castle
* ❌ShortCastle | LongCastle
    * 😡Less generic than Castle [Move]
* ❌CompositeMove [Move e1 g1, Move h1 f1]
    * 🙂Generic, probably can be used for en-passant as well
    * 😡Not clear that it's a castle
    * 😡Long name
* ❌Castle Move Move
    * 🙂Clear that it's a castle
    * 🙂Generic enough to represent every castle
    * 😡We'll need write more code, add more abstractions with no apparent benefit
